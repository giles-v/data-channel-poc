# Data Channel POC

A quick demo to work through a mechanism for passing a "path" down through a component tree, so that a consumer "leaf" component has context it needs to pull out it's own configuration.

This demo simply attempts to find an ergonomic way to implement props-passing down the tree. The leaf component simply displays the output.
